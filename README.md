<h1 align="center">  Barbershop </h1>

### :grey_question: About:
- This is the first project I worked on after finishing "HTML and CSS. Professional website layout" course
- An online barbershop website is a virtual platform that provides customers with information about the barbershop's services, enables them to book appointments, and products that can be purchased at the hair salon.

### :ballot_box_with_check: Tasks that were set:
- Create a homepage that includes a hero section with a high-quality image of the barbershop's interior, along with a clear call-to-action button that encourages visitors to book an appointment.
- Develop a services page that showcases the barbershop's various services, including haircuts, shaves, and beard trims, along with detailed descriptions and pricing information.
- Create a gallery section that contains images of products that can be purchased at the hair salon.
- Create a product card with product description, price, photos, etc

### :hammer_and_wrench: The technologies I used for this:
- HTML and CSS
- JavaScript
- Git/Github
